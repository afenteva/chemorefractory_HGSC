## Code Description
The code related to the study is represented in the form of Jupyter Notebooks. 

## Data Availability
All raw DNA sequencing data are submitted to the European Genome-phenome Archive (EGA) under study accession number EGAS00001006775. Raw bulk RNA sequencing data are deposited in the EGA under study accession number EGAS00001004714. Through EGA, these raw sequencing data can be made available to qualified researchers. Quantified signals for t-CycIF data will be available in Synapse upon publication. Unpublished raw scRNA-seq data will be deposited in the EGA, and processed scRNA-seq data will be deposited in Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) upon publication. Source data used in Fig. 3d and Extended Data Fig. 2a,c,d,e,f are provided in this paper. All other data supporting the results of this study are available from the corresponding author upon reasonable request.
